## Motivation
As a software developer who is visually impaired, I often struggle with reading long documents.

The PDF to Audio Converter is built using Python and utilizes the PyPDF2 and pyttsx3 libraries for PDF parsing and text-to-speech conversion, respectively. The software is designed to be cross-platform and should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
