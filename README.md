PDF to Audio Converter

#Introduction
The PDF to Audio Converter is a software tool that allows users to convert text from a PDF document into an audio file. The tool uses text-to-speech technology to convert the text in the PDF document into an audio file, which can then be played back on a computer or mobile device. This is a useful tool for individuals who prefer to listen to content rather than read it or for those with visual impairments.
